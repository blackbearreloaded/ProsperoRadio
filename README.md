# PS5 Native App Boilerplate

[![Host tooling](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate/actions/workflows/tooling.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-native-app-boilerplate/actions/workflows/tooling.yml)
[![License: GPL-3.0-or-later](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0--or--later-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Build native C and C++ homebrew applications for PlayStation 5 from Windows.
The template compiles with Clang in WSL, links a native PS5 ELF, wraps it as a
development FSELF, and assembles a complete title directory for a
directory-based homebrew loader.

The generated application is native code. C# and .NET are used only by the
host-side build tools. Pinned upstream dependencies are fetched on demand into
the ignored `.deps/` cache; no Sony SDK files or proprietary runtime modules
are included.

## Project status

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Host build | Verified on Windows with PowerShell, WSL, Clang 18, and .NET 10 |
| PS5 hardware | Verified on firmware 6.02 with ShadowMountPlus |
| Firmware 12.70 | Not compatible with the current clean-room runtime shim; the tested loader path failed before `main` and caused a probable console reboot |
| Output formats | Title folder, UFS2 `.ffpkg`, and compressed `.ffpfsc` |
| CI | Builds the host tooling and reproduces the bundled runtime shim |

Firmware and homebrew-loader behavior vary. Treat 6.02 as the current verified
baseline and validate the exact artifact on its target environment before
distribution. Do not present this template as firmware-independent.

## What is included

| Feature | Included implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Native build | C11 and basic C++20 compilation through the PS5 payload SDK |
| Linking and FSELF | Pinned SharpProspero revision plus a focused compatibility patch |
| Runtime companion | Source-reproducible, independently authored `libc.prx` loader shim |
| Packaging | Folder, optional UFS2 `.ffpkg`, and optional compressed `.ffpfsc` outputs |
| App assets | Recursive read-only `assets/` packaging at `/app0/assets/` |
| Presentation | Replaceable icon, 4K BC7 backgrounds, and ATRAC9 selection audio |
| Example | Graphical Hello World with CPU-rendered text, shapes, and packaged data |
| Validation | Host prerequisite checks and static ELF/FSELF inspection before release |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)
- Clang 18 inside WSL
- [PS5 payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk) at
  `/opt/ps5-payload-sdk`
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

### Build the template

1. Give the application a unique title ID, content ID, and name in
   [`project.json`](project.json).
2. Check the host prerequisites:

   ```powershell
   ./tools/doctor.ps1
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```powershell
   ./build.ps1
   ```

The finished title directory is written to `dist/<TITLE_ID>/`. Stage that
entire directory with a compatible loader such as
[ShadowMountPlus](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus); `eboot.bin`
cannot be deployed by itself.

Select an optional package format when needed:

```powershell
./build.ps1 -OutputFormat Ffpkg
./build.ps1 -OutputFormat Ffpfsc
./build.ps1 -OutputFormat All
```

If `dotnet` is not on `PATH`, pass its executable explicitly:

```powershell
./build.ps1 -Dotnet C:\path\to\dotnet.exe
```

Read [Getting started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) before the first build.

## Customize the application

### Source and metadata

Edit `project.json` to define the app identity, sources, compiler definitions,
include paths, static archives, and runtime modules. The default program is
[`src/main.c`](src/main.c); the complete graphical sample lives under
[`examples/hello-world`](examples/hello-world/README.md).

### Read-only application assets

Put fonts, images, configuration defaults, shaders, and other packaged data
under `assets/`. The build copies the directory recursively without
conversion:

```text
assets/fonts/ui.bin  ->  /app0/assets/fonts/ui.bin
```

Open packaged files through absolute `/app0/assets/...` paths. `/app0` is
read-only; writable application state belongs under `/download0`. The Hello
World example loads and renders `assets/banner.txt` at runtime.

### Presentation assets

Replace the icon and background with one command:

```powershell
./tools/prepare-assets.ps1 `
    -Icon C:\art\icon.png `
    -Background C:\art\background.png
```

The asset tool validates the required dimensions and prepares the PS5-facing
formats. Audio conversion and the verified Shell limits are documented in
[Presentation assets](docs/PRESENTATION_ASSETS.md).

## Build outputs

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>/` | Complete directory-style application |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>.ffpkg` | Optional uncompressed UFS2 image |
| `dist/<TITLE_ID>.ffpfsc` | Optional compressed UFS2 image |
| `build/` | Generated compiler, linker, and validation intermediates |

`build/`, `dist/`, `.deps/`, and `.local/` are intentionally ignored.

## Scope

This project builds a directory-style homebrew application and optional UFS2
images. It does not create a signed retail PKG/FPKG, automate an exploit, alter
console configuration, or bundle Sony files. GPU decoding and a general-purpose
C library are outside this foundation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Keep the template small, reproducible, and useful to
a first-time native-app developer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
the required checks.
