# Repository-local application builder

This folder contains the project-owned host-side frontend and clean-room runtime
emitter. The root `build.ps1` invokes `../tools/setup-tooling.ps1`, which fetches
the pinned SharpProspero source into the ignored `.deps/` cache when needed.

Requirements:

- Git for Windows and network access for the first dependency fetch.
- Windows .NET SDK 10 for `NativeAppBuilder`.
- WSL `/usr/bin/clang-18` and `/opt/ps5-payload-sdk` for compilation.
- The bundled clean-room `libc.prx`; its independent emitter is in
  `MinimalLibcBuilder` and its reproduction command is
  `../tools/rebuild-libc.ps1`.
